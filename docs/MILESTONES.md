---

## Phase Map

| Phase | Milestones | Theme | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | MS1–MS2 | Foundation — Auth, Tenants, Users | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 2** | MS3 | Catalog — Products, SKUs, Categories | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 3** | MS4–MS6 | Operations — Inventory, Orders, Payments | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 4** | MS7–MS8 | Hardening — Admin, UI Overhaul, Prod Prep | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 5** | MS9–MS10 | Extensions — CSV Import, Team Mgmt, Multi-Branch | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 6** | MS11 | Go-to-Market — Marketing Website | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 7** | — | Marketplace — Customer Storefront | 🔒 Do not build yet |
| **Phase 8** | — | Mobile + POS | 📋 PWA pre-staging; native app after revenue |
| **Phase 9** | — | AWS Scale + Subdomain Routing | 🔒 Do not build yet |

**Rules:**
- MVP = Phase 1–4 (MS1–MS8). First shippable product. ✅ Complete.
- 🔒 = architecturally designed, not yet scheduled.
- Never pull work from a future phase into a current milestone.

**On mobile:** PWA + responsive web ships **second-to-last before staging** — after all functionality is stabilised and MVP market-fit is confirmed. Doing it earlier means re-doing responsive work every time a panel changes. React Native native app (Phase 8) ships only after real revenue validates the investment. See "Mobile Strategy" in the Pre-Staging Checklist section for the full rationale.

## Pre-Staging Checklist

> Must complete — in this order — before any real client touches the product.

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | MS9 — username scoping, password change, negative stock floor, customerRef | ✅ Done | Merged |
| 2 | Marketing page (`apps/marketing`) | ✅ Done | MS11 merged |
| 3 | Multi-branch v1 (MS10) | ✅ Done | Merged |
| 4 | Dashboard / home screen (MS12) | ✅ Done | Summary cards, date range (presets + custom), 4 Recharts: area revenue, bar orders/day, donut status, horizontal bar low stock. |
| 5 | Basic reports (orders CSV export, date filter) | ✅ Done | MS13 — GET /reports/orders + CSV export, sidebar nav, date picker. |
| 6 | **Mobile responsive + PWA** | ✅ Done | MS14 — manifest, service worker, mobile drawer, horizontal-scroll tables, responsive sheets. |
| 7 | MS16 — UI/UX overhaul (inventory, filters, stock approvals, reports, dashboard widgets) | ✅ Done | Branch `milestone-16/ui-ux-overhaul` — 11 phases |
| 8 | Staging deployment | 📋 Next | Vercel (web + marketing) + Render (API) + Neon (DB) |

> **No tenant self-registration.** All tenants manually provisioned by Super Admin. Prospects book via Calendly → demo → owner creates their tenant. Self-serve signup only unlocks when a pricing model is defined.

### Single-Branch vs Multi-Branch Visibility Rules

All branch-aware UI is **hidden by default** and only appears when a tenant has more than 1 active branch. This ensures single-branch tenants see a clean, simple interface with no multi-branch concepts surfaced.

| UI Element | Single branch | Multi-branch |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|
| Branch switcher in header | Hidden | Visible |
| "All branches" option in switcher | — | Always shown (resets to tenant-wide scope) |
| Default branch auto-selected on load | No — starts at "All branches" | No — starts at "All branches" |
| Branch breakdown table on dashboard | Hidden | Visible |
| Accordion collapse on breakdown table | — | Shown when >5 branches |
| Search bar in branch switcher | — | Shown when >7 branches |
| "Viewing: 1 branch / show all" text on dashboard | Hidden | Visible when a branch is drilled into |
| Branch column in order/payment tables | Hidden | Future (post-MVP) |

**Scope of branch filter:**
- Global branch switcher (header) → scopes ALL tabs: Orders, Payments, Inventory
- Dashboard inline branch selector → scopes only dashboard cards and charts, does not affect other tabs
- "All branches" = no `x-branch-id` header sent → API returns full tenant-wide data

### Mobile Strategy — Why PWA, Not Native App

**The problem (valid):** The Philippine SMB market is mobile-first. Most business owners and staff operate from Android phones. A desktop-only app will have friction at every demo and daily use.

**The solution: PWA + responsive web — not React Native.**

| Approach | Timeline | Cost | Ships features instantly | Same codebase |
|----------|----------|------|------------------------|---------------|
| React Native app | +3–6 months | High | ❌ | ❌ |
| PWA + responsive | +2–3 weeks | Near zero | ✅ | ✅ |

A PWA installed on Android/iOS home screen is indistinguishable from a native app for the target use cases (create orders, check stock, log payments at counter). Native app (Phase 8) only makes sense after real revenue and validated demand for it.

**Role → device mapping:**
| Role | Likely device | Primary actions |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Owner / Admin | Phone or desktop | Reports, settings, team |
| Staff / Cashier | Phone at counter | Create orders, log payments |
| Warehouse staff | Phone on floor | Log movements, check stock |

## Gaps & Risks Analysis

> Run `/audit` before every PR. This table tracks known issues across the full platform.

### 🔴 Blocking — fix before staging

| # | Issue | Status | Fix |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Staff can't change their password | ✅ MS9 | `PATCH /auth/me/password` + settings UI card |
| 2 | Username collision across tenants | ✅ MS9 | `username` on `TenantMembership`, scoped `@@unique([tenantId, username])` |
| 3 | No customer reference on orders | ✅ MS9 | `customerRef String?` + `note String?` on `Order` |
| 4 | No dashboard / home screen | ✅ MS12 | Summary cards, date range (presets + custom), 4 animated Recharts (area, bar, donut, horizontal bar) |
| 5 | No marketing page / demo CTA | ✅ MS11 | `apps/marketing`, static Next.js, Calendly link |

### 🟡 Warning — fix before staging

| # | Issue | Status | Fix |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 6 | Stock goes negative on manual ADJUSTMENT | ✅ MS9 | Stock floor check added in `InventoryService` for negative adjustments |
| 7 | ₱ hardcoded in `payments.service.ts` notification body | ✅ Done | `payments.service.ts` — uses `toLocaleString('en-PH', { style: 'currency' })` |
| 8 | Duplicate `formatCents()` in `orders-panel.tsx` + `payments-panel.tsx`, both hardcode ₱ | ✅ Done | Extracted to `apps/web/src/lib/format.ts`; 4 local copies removed |
| 9 | Missing `@@index([status])` on `Order`, `Payment`, `TenantMembership`; missing `@@index([createdAt])` on `Order` | ✅ Done | Migration `20260330135249_add_status_createdat_indexes` |
| 10 | No basic reports or exports | ⏳ Pre-staging | CSV export on orders, date range filter |
| 11 | 7-day JWT — deactivating User (not membership) doesn't revoke access immediately | ❌ Open | Low risk now. TenantGuard checks membership status. Revisit at staging. |
| 12 | SMTP unconfigured locally — invites silently dropped | ❌ Open | Add Mailhog to local dev setup docs + `.env` warning |
| 27 | `uploads` controller missing `TenantGuard` | ❌ Open | `uploads.controller.ts:23` — any authenticated user can upload regardless of tenant. Add `TenantGuard` and scope files under `tenantId/`. |
| 28 | Hardcoded tenant slugs in `tenant-theme.ts` | ❌ Open | `tenant-theme.ts:46,62` — `peak-hardware` and `corner-general` baked into frontend theming. Move to a `theme` JSON column on `Tenant` before real clients onboard. |

### 🟢 Advisory — log and revisit

| # | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 13 | `UsersService.findById()` is dead code — exported, never called | ❌ Open | `users.service.ts:8`. Not a live leak. Remove to avoid confusion. |
| 14 | `Notification.tenantId` is nullable — not documented in schema | ❌ Open | Intentional for `PLATFORM_ALERT` type. Add inline comment to schema. |
| 15 | `OrderItem` has no `createdAt`/`updatedAt` | ❌ Open | Immutable by design (deleted+recreated on order edit). Timestamps would help audit trail. |
| 16 | Financial FK relations lack explicit `onDelete: Restrict` | ❌ Open | Currently relies on Postgres default. Make explicit before staging to prevent migration mistakes. |
| 17 | CSV import allows wrong `categorySlug` per business type | ❌ Open | UX issue. Pizza shop can import with `fasteners` category. Not a security risk. |
| 18 | No pricing / tiers | ✅ Intentional | Calendly model. Revisit post-staging with real client feedback. |
| 19 | Tenant self-registration | ✅ Intentional | Super Admin provisions manually. By design. |
| 29 | `GET /categories` has no auth guard | ❌ Open | `catalog.controller.ts:25` — categories are platform-owned public data, no tenant scope. Not sensitive, but inconsistent with rest of API. |
| 30 | `console.error` in bootstrap code | ❌ Open | `main.ts:59`, `env.validation.ts:39` — pino not available at startup so `console.error` is acceptable, but worth noting. |
| 31 | `localhost` fallback in `uploads.service.ts` | ❌ Open | `uploads.service.ts:43` — `?? 'http://localhost:3001'` safety net. `APP_BASE_URL` must be set in prod; env validation already enforces it. |
| 32 | `tenant.controller.ts` has no E2E spec | ❌ Open | `GET /tenant/context`, `PATCH /tenant/logo`, `GET /tenant/memberships` untested end-to-end. |

### ✅ Fixed This Milestone (MS9–MS12)

| # | Issue | Fixed in |
|---|-------|----------|
| 20 | Team list showing 0 members | MS9 — `JwtAuthGuard` missing on `GET /memberships/team` |
| 21 | Invite link pointed to API port (3001) | MS9 — `APP_FRONTEND_URL` env var |
| 22 | Login rejected phone/nickname identifiers | MS9 — `@IsEmail()` replaced with `@IsString()` on `LoginDto` |
| 23 | Direct-add staff have no email → can't use Forgot Password | MS9 — `PATCH /auth/me/password` endpoint + UI |
| 24 | Username collision across tenants (two Juans, different businesses) | MS9 — `membership.username` scoped per tenant |
| 25 | No multi-branch support | MS10 — `Branch` model, `BranchesModule`, `x-branch-id` header filtering, branch switcher UI |
| 26 | Dashboard was a stub with no real data | MS12 — `GET /dashboard` with date range, 4 animated charts (revenue area, orders bar, status donut, low stock horizontal bar) |

## PHASE 5 — Extensions 🚧

### MS9 — CSV Import + Team Management 🚧

#### CSV Import

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `POST /catalog/import` — multipart CSV, TenantGuard | ✅ | |
| Supported columns incl. snake_case aliases | ✅ | `pricePhp`, `costPhp` auto-converted to cents |
| Row-level validation: missing fields, duplicate codes, unknown category | ✅ | |
| Idempotent upsert by `(tenantId, skuCode)` | ✅ | |
| Response: `{ imported, updated, skipped, errors[] }` | ✅ | |
| E2E tests: 7 cases including tenant isolation | ✅ | |
| Drag-drop upload zone in Catalog panel | ✅ | |
| Download template button | ✅ | |
| Post-import result: counts + per-row error list | ✅ | |
| Preview table (first 10 rows before confirming) | ⏳ Deferred | Slot reserved in UI. Post-MS10. |
| Column mapping UI | ⏳ Deferred | Exact headers required; snake_case aliases reduce friction |

#### Team Management

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `GET /memberships/team` — all statuses (ACTIVE, INVITED, DISABLED) | ✅ | Fixed missing JwtAuthGuard |
| `POST /memberships/invite` — email invite, 48h token | ✅ | Links to `APP_FRONTEND_URL` |
| `POST /memberships/add-direct` — no-email staff, any identifier | ✅ | Account immediately ACTIVE |
| `PATCH /memberships/:id` — role, job title, deactivate, reactivate | ✅ | |

| Member list with status filter (All / Active / Pending / Deactivated) | ✅ | |
| Edit button → modal (role + job title) | ✅ | OWNER/ADMIN only |
| Deactivate / Cancel invite / Reactivate buttons per row | ✅ | |
| Add member dialog: Invite by email / Add directly toggle | ✅ | |

#### MS9 — Remaining (In Progress)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Username scoping — `username` on `TenantMembership`, not `User.email` | 🔴 Not started | Prevents collision: two "juan" at different tenants. Login adds optional "Business code" field. |
| Staff password change (`PATCH /auth/me/password`) | 🔴 Not started | Direct-add staff have no email → can't use Forgot Password |
| Negative stock floor on manual OUT movements | 🔴 Not started | Manual adjustments bypass the check that order confirmation enforces |
| `customerRef` on orders | 🔴 Not started | B2B dealbreaker: who placed the order? |

### MS10 — Multi-Branch Support 📋

> **Deploy strategy:** Multi-branch v1 ships **before staging** as a scaffolded invisible feature. Single-branch tenants see zero UI change. Branch switcher appears only when a tenant has >1 branch.

#### Context

| Business | Type | Multi-branch need |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Manager's Pizza (tenant 1) | Food wholesale + retail | Central kitchen + outlets |
| Megabox (tenant 2) | Pizza equipment supplier | Warehouse + retail counter |

> These are two separate **tenants** (already solved). Multi-branch = locations *within* each tenant.

#### Design Decisions

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Stock pools | Independent per branch |
| Catalog (products/SKUs) | Shared across tenant |
| Orders | Branch-scoped (fulfilled from a specific branch) |
| Inventory movements | Branch-scoped |
| Payments | Tenant-wide (tied to orders) |
| Staff assignment | Optional branch restriction (empty = all branches) |
| "All Branches" view | Aggregated totals for Owner/Admin |
| Single-branch behavior | Branch switcher hidden; all queries use default branch implicitly |

#### Data Model Changes

| Change | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `Branch` table: `id`, `tenantId`, `name`, `address`, `isDefault`, `status` | Auto-created on tenant creation |
| `InventoryMovement.branchId` FK (nullable) | Nullable for historical data |
| `Order.branchId` FK (nullable) | Nullable for historical data |
| `TenantMembership.branchIds` JSON array | Empty = access to all branches |
| `Sku.stockOnHand` | Stays as tenant-wide total. Per-branch via movement aggregation. `BranchInventory` table in full MS10. |

#### API Additions

| Endpoint | Guard | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `GET /branches` | TenantGuard | List branches for tenant |
| `POST /branches` | TenantGuard (OWNER/ADMIN) | Create branch |
| `PATCH /branches/:id` | TenantGuard (OWNER/ADMIN) | Update name, address, status |
| `x-branch-id` header | Optional | If omitted → tenant-wide aggregated scope |

#### UI Changes

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| Sidebar / header | Branch switcher (hidden when 1 branch) |
| All panels | Filter by active branch or show aggregated |
| Settings | Branches tab: list, create, edit, deactivate |
| Team members | Branch assignment per member |

---

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Global marketplace (`/marketplace`) | Customers browse across all tenants |
| Per-tenant storefront (`/shop/:tenantSlug`) | Scoped to one seller |

|------|--------|-------|
| **PWA + mobile responsive web** | ⏳ Pre-staging | `manifest.json`, service worker, responsive CSS pass on `apps/web`. Ships before staging. |
| Mobile app (React Native / Expo) | 🔒 Phase 8 | Only after staging is live, real clients confirmed, and revenue validates the investment. |
| POS + barcode scanning | 🔒 Phase 8 | Requires hardware integrations and dedicated mobile engineer. |

## Feature Backlog

> Designed and ready to scope. Not phase-assigned. Do not implement speculatively.

| Feature | Priority | Phase | Prerequisite | Why Deferred |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Sidebar UX overhaul — wider, bigger text (18px base), icons on nav items, all values in config | 🟡 Medium | Pre-staging | — | Modern SaaS standard. Current sidebar is functional but compact. Text sizing trend is 17–18px base. Centralize all nav config. |
| Reports / CSV export (orders, payments) | 🔴 High | Pre-staging | MS9 done | Day-one client ask — "how much did we sell this month?" |
| `customerRef` + `note` on orders | 🔴 High | MS9 | — | Moved up — B2B dealbreaker |
| Low Stock Threshold + Alerts | 🟡 Medium | Post-Phase 4 | External notifications | `lowStockThreshold` exists on SKU. Needs notification channel. |
| External Notification Delivery | 🟡 Medium | Post-Phase 4 | MS8 notifications | Email first, then Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS. BullMQ queue. |
| Queryable Audit Log | 🟡 Medium | Post-Phase 4 | — | "Who changed this order?" High value for enterprise. |
| OAuth / Social Login | 🟢 Low | Post-Phase 4 | — | Email/password sufficient. Requires app registration. |
| i18n + Currency settings | 🟢 Low | Post-Phase 4 | Stable UI | ₱ hardcoded now. Add `Tenant.locale` + `Tenant.currency`. |
| Custom Roles | 🟢 Low | Post-Phase 4 | — | OWNER/ADMIN/STAFF/VIEWER covers 90% of use cases. |
| Super Admin Impersonation | 🟢 Low | Post-Phase 4 | Audit Log | Support/debug tool. Requires full audit trail first. |
| Payroll Module | 🔒 Locked | Post-Phase 5 | Multi-Branch | Regulated domain. Validate demand before committing. |
| Platform Integrations (Shopee, Lazada) | 🔒 Locked | Post-Phase 5 | Stable core | Webhook security, retry logic, idempotency add complexity. |
| AI Chatbot + RAG | 🔒 Locked | Post-Phase 5 | Real tenant data | Claude API + pgvector. Feature-flagged per tenant. |
| **Customer-Seller Chat** | 🔒 Locked | Post-Phase 7 | Customer portal | Two tracks: (1) **Internal order notes** — staff/admin attach notes to a specific order, visible within the ERP; low-effort, high-value for B2B ops. (2) **Buyer-facing portal chat** — real-time or async messaging between buyer and seller, tied to an order/session; requires buyer auth, separate portal surface, and WebSocket infra. Do Track 1 first. Track 2 only after the marketplace (Phase 7) is live and validated. |

## Known Engineering Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Permission drift** | Staff accumulate custom overrides; role changes may conflict | Add "reset to role default" action in PBAC UI |
| **Privilege escalation** | ADMIN must not grant permissions exceeding their own ceiling | Guards validate acting user's scope, not just target role |
| **JWT token lag** | Permission changes take effect at next login (7-day JWT) | Check `membership.status` on every protected request |
| **Concurrent order confirmation race** | Two simultaneous CONFIRM requests both pass stock check | Mitigated by `$transaction` wrapping stock check + decrement |
| **Username collision (pre-fix)** | Two "juan" at different tenants crash | Fix: `username` on `TenantMembership` with `@@unique([tenantId, username])` |
| **Low stock alert spam** | Stock hovering at threshold fires on every OUT movement | Cooldown per SKU (`lastAlertedAt`) — max one alert per 6h |
| **Messenger / WhatsApp template constraint** | Meta only allows free-form within 24h reply window | Register message templates before launch |
| **Render cold starts** | Free tier spins down after ~15min idle — 10–30s first request | Document for testing; upgrade to Render Starter before real users |
| **Neon connection exhaustion** | Prisma opens connection per request; free tier has low ceiling | Add PgBouncer or Prisma Accelerate before production load |
| **Branch migration risk** | MS10 changes `stockOnHand` semantics (per-branch vs total) | Plan migration carefully; existing data → default branch. Test on staging first. |
| **Integration webhook security** | External platforms must authenticate webhook payloads | Verify HMAC signatures on all incoming requests |
